# expressNoteTaker

# Description
This project involves using Node.js, Express.js and several dependencies to create a NoteTaker application. The purpose of this application is to record messages and save the message to view at a later time. It uniquely stores each message so that every message can be accessed on the left side of the application. The saved messages display the title of the note, and when clicked on, the entire body text appears. 

# Installation
To install this project, clone the repo onto your local device. Ensure Node.js is installed on your device. Afterwards, use npm install to download all the dependencies required to run this application. 

# Usage
After pressing the Get Started button on the home page, you are directed to the Note Taking page. On the body of the page, you can type the title and name of the message. When the message is complete, you can press the save icon on the top right to save the note. Afterwards, the note is saved, and then you can create as many notes as you please. To delete a note, press the trash can icon to remove the note from your list. When you press the title of a saved note, the note populates the body of the page, displaying what was saved earlier. Below is a screenshot of the application in progress.
